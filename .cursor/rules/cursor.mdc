# 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW - 8 STEPS

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Follow ALL 8 steps in order. No skipping.**

---

## 📋 THE 8 STEPS (DO IN ORDER)

### STEP 1: Read Project Structure
- Read `document/project-structure.md`
- **Why**: Understand project before starting

### STEP 2: Check Doing Directory
- Check `document/doing/` exists
- **If exists**: Read 3 files (`01_doing.md`, `02_structure.md`, `03_implement_note.md`)
- **If not exists**: Create directory and 3 files
- **Important**: Delete any extra files (keep only 3 files)

### STEP 3: Ask User
- Ask: "Continue previous job or start new job?"
- **If new job**: Ask if user wants to clear work files

### STEP 4: Read Application Instructions
- Read `document/Application-instruction.md`
- **Why**: Understand coding rules

### STEP 5: Read Module Documentation
- Read relevant docs from `document/modules/`
- **Why**: Understand the module you're working on

### STEP 6: Create/Update Work Files
- Create/update 3 files in `document/doing/`:
  1. `01_doing.md` - **ALL checklists go here**
  2. `02_structure.md` - Files and changes
  3. `03_implement_note.md` - Implementation notes
- **Rule**: Only 3 files allowed. All checklists in `01_doing.md` only.

### STEP 7: Work & Update ⚠️ MOST IMPORTANT
**After EVERY activity (create file, modify file, run test, etc.):**
1. Run `date` → get timestamp
2. Update `01_doing.md` → mark ✅, add log entry
3. Update `02_structure.md` → if files changed
4. Update `03_implement_note.md` → add details

**Example:**
```
Create file X.tsx
→ date → update 01_doing.md (✅ + log)
→ update 02_structure.md (add file)
→ update 03_implement_note.md (note created)
```

### STEP 8: Finish
- Update module docs if needed
- Update `document/project-structure.md` if structure changed
- Wait for user confirmation
- Clear 3 work files after user OK

## 📁 THE 3 WORK FILES

**Rule**: `document/doing/` must have EXACTLY 3 files:
1. `01_doing.md` - All checklists
2. `02_structure.md` - Files and changes
3. `03_implement_note.md` - Implementation notes

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES

### Timestamps
- ✅ ALWAYS run `date` command (never use hardcoded dates)
- ✅ Use output directly in work files
- ❌ NEVER use model-generated or fixed timestamps

### Doing Directory
- ✅ Keep ONLY 3 files
- ✅ All checklists in `01_doing.md` only
- ✅ Update files IMMEDIATELY after every activity
- ❌ NEVER create extra files
- ❌ NEVER skip updates

### Work Updates
- ✅ After EVERY activity → update all 3 files
- ✅ One activity at a time → update → next activity
- ❌ NEVER do multiple activities without updating

---

## ✅ QUICK CHECKLIST

**Before starting:**
- [ ] Read project-structure.md
- [ ] Check doing/ directory (3 files only)
- [ ] Ask user about job
- [ ] Read Application-instruction.md
- [ ] Read module docs
- [ ] Create/update 3 work files

**During work:**
- [ ] After each activity → run `date`
- [ ] Update `01_doing.md` (✅ + log)
- [ ] Update `02_structure.md` (if files changed)
- [ ] Update `03_implement_note.md` (add details)

**Before done:**
- [ ] All tasks marked ✅
- [ ] All timestamps from `date` command
- [ ] Only 3 files in doing/ directory
- [ ] All checklists in `01_doing.md`
- [ ] User confirmed work
- [ ] Cleared work files

---

## 🎯 SIMPLE WORKFLOW

**Start:**
1. Read project-structure.md
2. Check doing/ (3 files)
3. Ask user
4. Read instructions
5. Read module docs
6. Create work files

**Work:**
- Do activity → `date` → update 3 files → next activity

**Finish:**
- Update docs → wait user OK → clear work files

---

## 🚨 FINAL REMINDER

**MUST DO:**
1. Follow 8 steps in order
2. Update doing files after EVERY activity
3. Keep only 3 files in doing/ directory
4. All checklists in `01_doing.md` only
5. Use `date` command for timestamps

**If tempted to skip → STOP → follow exactly as written.**

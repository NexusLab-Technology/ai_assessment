## 🚨 **MANDATORY WORKFLOW - 8 SIMPLE STEPS**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST do ALL 8 steps in order. No skipping. No shortcuts.**

### **Step 1: Read Project Structure (REQUIRED FIRST)**
- **MUST** read `document/project-structure.md` before any other action
- **Purpose**: Understand project architecture and organization
- **Timing**: Before reading any other files or starting work

### **Step 2: Check Existing Work (REQUIRED SECOND)**
- **MUST** check if `document/doing/` directory exists
- **If EXISTS**: Read all three files completely (`01_doing.md`, `02_structure.md`, `03_implement_note.md`)
- **If NOT EXISTS**: Create the directory and files
- **Purpose**: Track progress and ensure nothing is missed, enable work continuation
- **Timing**: After reading project structure, before starting work

### **Step 3: Ask About Job Continuation (REQUIRED THIRD)**
- **MUST** ask user if switching modules/functions OR task is not related to current work
- **Ask**: "Continue previous job or start new job?"
- **If starting new job**: Ask "Do you want me to clear the work files (01-03) to prepare for the new task?"
- **Purpose**: Prevent work disruption and ensure proper task management
- **Timing**: After checking existing work, before proceeding

### **Step 4: Read Application Instructions (REQUIRED FOURTH)**
- **MUST** read `document/Application-instruction.md` for coding rules
- **Purpose**: Understand development requirements and constraints
- **Timing**: After asking about job continuation, before reading code

### **Step 5: Read Module Documentation (REQUIRED FIFTH)**
- **MUST** read relevant module documentation for context
- **Purpose**: Understand the specific module being worked on
- **Timing**: After reading application instructions, before reading code

### **Step 6: Create/Update Work Files (REQUIRED SIXTH)**
- **MUST** create/update these three files in `document/doing/`:
  - `01_doing.md` - Current checklist and tasks
  - `02_structure.md` - Project structure for current module
  - `03_implement_note.md` - Implementation notes and logs
- **Purpose**: Track progress and maintain work history
- **Timing**: After reading module documentation, before starting work

### **Step 7: Execute Work with Updates**
- **MUST** update checklist after completing each step
- **MUST** include detailed file information and descriptions for each completed step
- **Required Information**: File path, what was changed, why it was changed, and any important details
- **Purpose**: Maintain progress tracking, accountability, and create comprehensive work history for future reference
- **Timing**: Throughout the entire work process

### **Step 8: Update Documentation & Cleanup**
- **MUST** update relevant module documentation if changes were made
- **MUST** update `document/project-structure.md` if project structure changed
- **MUST** wait for user to confirm work is satisfactory
- **MUST** clear all three work files after user confirms completion
- **Purpose**: Keep documentation current and accurate, prevent file accumulation
- **Timing**: After all work is complete and user approves

## ❌ **NEVER DO THIS**

- ❌ Start work without reading `document/project-structure.md` first
- ❌ Start work without checking `document/doing/` folder
- ❌ Skip reading `document/Application-instruction.md`
- ❌ Skip reading relevant module documentation
- ❌ Start coding before understanding the project structure
- ❌ Skip updating the checklist after each step
- ❌ Skip user confirmation before cleanup
- ❌ Leave work files in `document/doing/` after completion
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Use model-generated dates or timestamps
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Use fixed dates instead of current local machine time
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Use UTC/server time for user-facing datetime fields
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Reuse old timestamps - ALWAYS get fresh time
- ❌ Switch tasks without asking user first
- ❌ Skip marking completed tasks as ✅ in checklist
- ❌ Work without detailed sub-step breakdown
- ❌ Skip any of the 8 mandatory steps

---

## ✅ **ALWAYS DO THIS**

- ✅ Read `document/project-structure.md` FIRST
- ✅ Check `document/doing/` folder SECOND (read or create files)
- ✅ Ask user about job continuation THIRD (if switching tasks)
- ✅ Read `document/Application-instruction.md` FOURTH
- ✅ Read relevant module documentation FIFTH
- ✅ Create/update the 3 work files SIXTH
- ✅ Break down work into detailed sub-steps in checklist
- ✅ Do ONE sub-step at a time
- ✅ IMMEDIATELY mark each completed task as ✅ in the checklist
- ✅ IMMEDIATELY update `01_doing.md` after each sub-step
- ✅ Update module documentation if new requirements/features are added
- ✅ Update docs if project structure changes
- ✅ Wait for user confirmation when done
- ✅ Clear all three work files after confirmation
- ✅ **CRITICAL**: Use local machine datetime for all timestamps
- ✅ **CRITICAL**: Get current time using system commands (e.g., `date`)
- ✅ **CRITICAL**: Use local timezone format for datetime fields
- ✅ **CRITICAL**: Run `date` command EVERY TIME you need to mention time
- ✅ **CRITICAL**: Follow ALL 8 steps in order - no skipping

---

## ⚡ **QUICK COMMANDS**

**Check if work files exist:**
```bash
ls -la document/doing/
```

**Get current time (USE THIS EVERY TIME YOU NEED TIME):**
```bash
date
```

**Clear work files when done:**
```bash
echo "" > document/doing/01_doing.md
echo "" > document/doing/02_structure.md  
echo "" > document/doing/03_implement_note.md
```

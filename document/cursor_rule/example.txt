## 🚨 **MANDATORY WORKFLOW - FOLLOW THESE 8 STEPS IN ORDER**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Execute ALL 8 steps sequentially. No skipping. No shortcuts.**

---

## 📋 **THE 8 STEPS - DO IN THIS EXACT ORDER**

### **STEP 1: Read Project Structure** ⭐ START HERE
**Action**: Read `document/project-structure.md` completely
**Why**: Understand project architecture before doing anything else
**When**: Before reading any other files or starting work
**How**: Use `read_file` tool to read the file

### **STEP 2: Check Existing Work**
**Action**: 
- Check if `document/doing/` directory exists using `list_dir`
- **If EXISTS**: Read all 3 files (`01_doing.md`, `02_structure.md`, `03_implement_note.md`)
- **If NOT EXISTS**: Create the directory and initialize the 3 files
**Why**: Track progress and continue previous work if any
**When**: Immediately after Step 1

### **STEP 3: Ask About Job Continuation**
**Action**: Ask user: "Continue previous job or start new job?"
- If starting new job: Ask "Do you want me to clear the work files (01-03) to prepare for the new task?"
**Why**: Prevent disrupting ongoing work
**When**: After Step 2, before proceeding

### **STEP 4: Read Application Instructions**
**Action**: Read `document/Application-instruction.md` completely
**Why**: Understand coding rules and constraints
**When**: After Step 3, before reading any code

### **STEP 5: Read Module Documentation**
**Action**: Read relevant module docs from `docs/modules/` based on the task
**Why**: Understand the specific module you're working on
**When**: After Step 4, before reading code

### **STEP 6: Create/Update Work Files**
**Action**: Create or update these 3 files in `document/doing/`:
- `01_doing.md` - Task checklist (use template below)
- `02_structure.md` - Files you're working with
- `03_implement_note.md` - Implementation notes
**Why**: Track progress and maintain work history
**When**: After Step 5, before starting actual work

### **STEP 7: Execute Work with Real-Time Updates**
**Action**: 
- Do ONE sub-step at a time
- **IMMEDIATELY** mark task as ✅ in `01_doing.md` after completing
- **IMMEDIATELY** update `01_doing.md` with: timestamp (run `date`), file path, what changed, why changed
- Update `02_structure.md` and `03_implement_note.md` as you work
**Why**: Maintain accountability and progress tracking
**When**: Throughout entire work process

### **STEP 8: Update Documentation & Cleanup**
**Action**: 
- Update relevant module documentation if changes were made
- Update `document/project-structure.md` if structure changed
- Wait for user confirmation
- Clear all 3 work files after user confirms completion
**Why**: Keep docs current and prevent file accumulation
**When**: After all work is complete and user approves

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL RULES - TIMESTAMP HANDLING**

**🚨 NEVER:**
- ❌ Use model-generated dates or timestamps
- ❌ Use fixed dates or hardcoded timestamps
- ❌ Use UTC/server time for timestamps
- ❌ Reuse old timestamps from previous entries

**✅ ALWAYS:**
- ✅ Run `date` command EVERY TIME you need a timestamp
- ✅ Use the output from `date` command directly
- ✅ Use local machine time for all timestamps
- ✅ Get fresh timestamp for each entry

**Example:**
```bash
# Run this command every time you need a timestamp
date
# Output: Wed Jan  7 16:14:29 +07 2026
# Use this exact output in your work files
```

---

## ❌ **NEVER DO THIS**

1. **Skip Steps**: Never skip any of the 8 mandatory steps
2. **Start Without Reading**: Never start work without reading `document/project-structure.md` first
3. **Ignore Existing Work**: Never start without checking `document/doing/` folder
4. **Skip Documentation**: Never skip reading `document/Application-instruction.md` or module docs
5. **Code Before Understanding**: Never start coding before understanding project structure
6. **Forget Updates**: Never skip updating checklist after completing each step
7. **No User Confirmation**: Never cleanup without user confirmation
8. **Leave Work Files**: Never leave work files in `document/doing/` after completion
9. **Switch Tasks**: Never switch tasks without asking user first
10. **No Progress Tracking**: Never work without marking completed tasks as ✅

---

## ✅ **ALWAYS DO THIS**

1. **Follow 8 Steps**: Execute all 8 steps in exact order
2. **Read First**: Read `document/project-structure.md` before anything else
3. **Check Work Files**: Check `document/doing/` folder second
4. **Ask User**: Ask about job continuation third
5. **Read Instructions**: Read `document/Application-instruction.md` fourth
6. **Read Module Docs**: Read relevant module documentation fifth
7. **Create Work Files**: Create/update 3 work files sixth
8. **Update Real-Time**: Update checklist IMMEDIATELY after each step
9. **One Step at a Time**: Do ONE sub-step, mark ✅, then move to next
10. **Fresh Timestamps**: Run `date` command for every timestamp entry
11. **Update Docs**: Update module documentation when changes are made
12. **Wait for Confirmation**: Wait for user confirmation before cleanup
13. **Clear Files**: Clear all 3 work files after user confirms completion

---

## ⚡ **QUICK REFERENCE COMMANDS**

### **Check Work Files:**
```bash
list_dir document/doing/
# Or use: ls -la document/doing/
```

### **Get Current Timestamp (USE EVERY TIME):**
```bash
date
# Example output: Wed Jan  7 16:14:29 +07 2026
# Copy this exact output into your work files
```

### **Clear Work Files (After User Confirmation):**
```bash
write document/doing/01_doing.md ""
write document/doing/02_structure.md ""
write document/doing/03_implement_note.md ""
```

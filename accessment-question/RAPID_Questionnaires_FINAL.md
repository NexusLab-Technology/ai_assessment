## Step 4: Model Evaluation

### 4.1 Evaluation Process Guidelines

#### Prepare Data Samples

**Select Evaluation Basis**

Select between ground truth samples or deterministic metrics for evaluation.

**Prepare Data**

Clean and format samples properly while ensuring they represent actual use cases.

**Include Test Scenarios**

Incorporate both common scenarios and edge cases for thorough testing.

**Maintain Standards**

Use consistent structure, provide relevant context, and follow standardized formatting.

**Assess Quality**

Verify data cleanliness, context length, documentation, input variety, and error conditions.

#### Select Evaluation Frameworks and Metrics

**Define Evaluation Metrics**

Select appropriate evaluation metrics for GenAI use cases, combining both human SME evaluation and automated metrics for better scalability and objectivity. Options include:
• Human evaluation by Subject Matter Experts (SME)
• Automated evaluation metrics

**Define the clear Success Criteria**

After obtaining alignment on the evaluation methods and metrics with stakeholders, please work with them to define clear success criteria.

#### Model Selection

**Model Selection**

Select LLM / FM that meets key evaluating criteria, such as:
• Input and output modalities (text, code, multi-modal capabilities)
• Context window size: Maximum input tokens the model can process
• Cost per inference or token
• Performance metrics (latency, throughput)
• Output quality and accuracy
• Domain specialization and specific use case compatibility
• Hosting options (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)
• Data privacy and security requirements

#### Evaluation and Optimization

**Test model response**

Run the model

**Capture evaluation results**

Capture automated and Human evaluation results

**Prompt Optimization**

Optimize prompt to enhance performance through refined inputs and automated tools, such as, Bedrock Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) and Metaprompt tool offered by Anthropic.

**Latency Optimization**

Reduce the latency by optimizing prompt to generate shorter answers (reduce the number of output tokens) and when needed use Provisioned Throughput

**Refine LLM responses**

Evaluation of generated response is an iterative process. Test and redefine/optimize prompts, models, and configurations with controlled variables.

**Cost calculation**

For LLM invocation, the cost can be calculated based on the number of input and output tokens and the corresponding price per token:

LLM_invocation_cost = number_of_input_tokens * price_per_input_token + number_of_output_tokens * price_per_output_token

**Document model performance comparison**

Prepare model performance (accuracy, latency, cost, & more) for all the tested models.

### 4.2 Evaluation Metrics

#### Latency

- **Latency:** Response time for model inference
- **Throughput:** Number of requests processed per unit time
- **TTFT:** Time To First Token - Time until first response token
- **Other:** Other latency-related metrics
